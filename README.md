# How To Use

The `text` folder contains most constants, such as the user's token and the help menus.
- Set `text/login.txt` to your Discord bot's token so the program could log on. If you would like to use an environment variable, you may by editing the end of `main.py`.
- Set `text/admin.txt` to a list of program administrators. The first item should be a developer because the first person is pinged when an error occurs.
- Set `text/badWords.txt` to a list of words that the program should react X to. No punishments are given out, but only a reaction and a reply.

# Creation

MonkeyBot was created on January 19 2024 as a way to improve my programming skills whilst entertaining friends. While I am dynamically adding features on-the-go, I usually improve the hasty code I wrote for other features.

# Future Improvement

An overhaul of the code is planned to make the code easier to read and to use. Additionally, any issues with the current system will be sorted out once the new system is created. Because MonkeyBot is a first, the code will be unplanned, intended to test out features, which were probably learned the very same day.

# Feature Addition

Submit an issue and add the tag `enhancement`. Set the title to a short instructional summary, such as "Say 'good morning' in Text Channel at Specified Time" or "Reply to Certain Messages with Predetermined Responses"
